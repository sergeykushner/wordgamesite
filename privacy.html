                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are

                  I may employ third-party companies and

                  I want to inform users of this Service
                  that these third parties have access to their Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.

                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
